Feel free to check out some of my pinned repos down below, or check out my website, https://ktibow.github.io/!  
I wish everybody used the same time zone. (I use Pacific Time). I'm off the computer from 1AM to 11AM UTC (sleeping), and won't always be available (even though I try).  
Have a question about me? [Just ask on GitHub.](https://github.com/KTibow/KTibow/issues) I'm not available for hiring or anything.  
I don't have a buymeacoffee or anything (I probably should), but you can give me nitro at KTibow#3960 on Discord.
