# Hi there!
Yet another developer. Check out some of my pinned repos below, or [my website](https://ktibow.github.io).  
[![Does not contain tree nuts](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/does-not-contain-treenuts.svg)](#) [![Contains technical debt](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/contains-technical-debt.svg)](#) [![Ages: 12+](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/ages-12.svg)](#)
## Contacting me
- `@mention` me if needed, I check GitHub notifications. You could [even raise an issue here](https://github.com/KTibow/KTibow/issues).
- Sadly I won't be taking your money anytime soon, as I'm not available for hiring and don't have a buymeacoffee. If you tried to gift me a subscription (eg Nitro)... it's a waste, although I might accept anyways.
